## Introduction to Data Science 

### I want to share my opinion about data science for the project of Patila.dev. 
I had studied Geomatics Engineering department and recently graduated. So, I have worked with spatial data. In this century which the technology developing rapidly, 
spatial data importance has increased. For example, the last three years, World has faced Covid virus and tried to control the virus by using the patient's locations
and then formed a map that shows number of Covid patients. Examined all the symptoms, recorded it and tried to find a similarity or a pattern of covid patients. Using 
all data about Covid, made predictions about the future for example when the virus will increase or ends.
Another example for spatial data, nowadays 3D city modelling is very popular. There are lots of maps in 2D but it is not enough anymore. Specialists collects data as 
aerial images or point clouds, then labels the objects in the data like trees, buildings, cars etc. The labelling step is a time consuming process. To avoid this, speacialists
generally use machine learning approach. Label a small part of the data, run it in algorithm, do it until the acceptance level and test the algorithm to the remaning of the data.
